In this example we have data with multiple variables, we have 3 independents, area,bedrooms,age to find the price so we pass these 3 variables into the 2d array as an argument to the fit function of the LinearRegression object and pass the price as the second argument and the fit function will train the model depending on these 3 independent variables, it will find the slopes and intercepts so we can later on predict other prices depending on those 3 independent variables, area,bedrooms,age. <br>

I wanted to show this example for you to see what we need to do if we have multiple variables to find a prediction for something such as price. So price depends on these 3 variables area,bedrooms,age in this case.
