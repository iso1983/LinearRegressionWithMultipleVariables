In this example we have data with multiple variables, we have 3 independents, area,bedrooms,age to find the price so we pass these 3 variables into the 2d array as an argument to the fit function of the LinearRegression object which will train the model depending on these 3 independent variables. I wanted to show this example for you to see what we need to do if we have multiple variables to find a prediction for something such as price. So price depends on these 3 variables area,bedrooms,age.
